    "Who are you gooning to right now? Who is it you think you rizz? Do you know how much I mew a year? I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe it. Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop mewing into work? A gyat big enough that it could be listed on the skibidi toilet goes gyat up. Disappears! It ceases to mew without me. No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me rizz you in. I am not in sigma, Skyler. I am the sigma. A beta opens his door and gets mogged, and you think that of me? No. I am the one who mogs!",

    "I like to creep around my home and act like a goblin I don’t know why but I just enjoy doing this. Maybe it’s my way of dealing with stress or something but I just do it about once every week. Generally I’ll carry around a sack and creep around in a sort of crouch-walking position making goblin noises, then I’ll walk around my house and pick up various different “trinkets” and put them in my bag while saying stuff like “I’ll be having that” and laughing maniacally in my goblin voice (“trinkets” can include anything from shit I find on the ground to cutlery or other utensils). The other day I was talking with my neighbours and they mentioned hearing weird noises like what I wrote about and I was just internally screaming the entire conversation. I’m 99% sure they don’t know it’s me but god that 1% chance is seriously weighing on my mind.",
